# Codex Rust Bindings

This repository provides Rust bindings for the Codex library, enabling seamless integration with Rust projects.

## Usage

Include in your Cargo project:

```toml
[dependencies]
codex-rust-bindings = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

For an example on how to use this package, please take a look at our [examples](./examples/) directory.

## Development

To build the required dependencies for this module, the `make` command needs to be executed.
If you are integrating this module into another project via `cargo add`, ensure that you navigate
to the `codex-rust-bindings` module directory and run the `make` commands.

### Steps to install

Follow these steps to install and set up the module:

1. Make sure your system has the [prerequisites](https://github.com/codex-storage/nim-codex) to run a local Codex node.

2. Fetch the dependencies:

   ```
   make update
   ```

3. Build the library:
   ```
   make libcodex
   ```

You can pass flags to the Codex building step by using `CODEX_LIB_PARAMS`. For example,
if you want to enable debug API for peers, you can build the library using:

```
CODEX_LIB_PARAMS="-d:codex_enable_api_debug_peers=true" make libcodex
```

Now the module is ready for use in your project.

The release process is defined [here](./RELEASE.md).

## API

### Init

First you need to create a Codex node:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{CodexNode, CodexConfig};

let config = CodexConfig::new()
    .data_dir("/path/to/data")
    .block_retries(10);

let mut node = CodexNode::new(config)?;
// ...
node.destroy()?;
```

The `CodexConfig` object provides several options to configure your node. You should at least
adjust the `data_dir` folder and the `block_retries` setting to avoid long retrieval times when
the data is unavailable.

When you are done with your node, you **have to** call `destroy()` method to free resources.

### Start / Stop

Use `start()` method to start your node. You **have to** call `stop()` before `destroy()` when you are done
with your node.

```rust
node.start()?;
node.stop()?;
node.destroy()?;
```

### Info

You can get the version and revision without starting the node:

```rust
let version = node.version()?;
let revision = node.revision()?;
```

Other information is available after the node is started:

```rust
let version = node.version()?;
let spr = node.spr()?;
let peer_id = node.peer_id()?;
```

### Upload

There are 3 strategies for uploading: `reader`, `file` or `chunks`. Each one requires its own upload session.

#### reader

The `reader` strategy is the easiest option when you already have a Rust `Read`.
It handles creating the upload session and cancels it if an error occurs.

The `filepath` should contain the data's name with its extension, because Codex uses that to
infer the MIME type.

An `on_progress` callback is available to receive progress updates and notify the user.
The total size of the reader is determined via `stat` when it wraps a file, or from the buffer length otherwise.
From there, the callback can compute and report the percentage complete.

The `upload_reader` returns the cid of the content uploaded.

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{upload_reader, UploadOptions};
use std::io::Cursor;

let data = b"Hello World!";
let reader = Cursor::new(data);
let on_progress = |progress| {
    println!("Upload progress: {} bytes ({}%)",
        progress.bytes_uploaded,
        (progress.percentage * 100.0) as u32);
};

let options = UploadOptions::new()
    .filepath("hello.txt")
    .on_progress(on_progress);

let cid = upload_reader(&node, options, reader)?;
```

#### file

The `file` strategy allows you to upload a file on Codex using the path.
It handles creating the upload session and cancels it if an error occurs.

The `on_progress` callback is the same as for `reader` strategy.

The `upload_file` returns the cid of the content uploaded.

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{upload_file, UploadOptions};

let on_progress = |progress| {
    println!("Upload progress: {} bytes ({}%)",
        progress.bytes_uploaded,
        (progress.percentage * 100.0) as u32);
};

let options = UploadOptions::new()
    .filepath("./testdata/hello.txt")
    .on_progress(on_progress);

let cid = upload_file(&node, options)?;
```

#### chunks

The `chunks` strategy allows you to manage the upload by yourself. It requires more code
but provides more flexibility. You have to create the upload session, send the chunks
and then finalize to get the cid.

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{upload_init, upload_chunk, upload_finalize, UploadOptions};

let session_id = upload_init(&node, &UploadOptions::new().filepath("hello.txt"))?;

upload_chunk(&node, &session_id, b"Hello ")?;
upload_chunk(&node, &session_id, b"World!")?;

let cid = upload_finalize(&node, &session_id)?;
```

Using this strategy, you can handle resumable uploads and cancel the upload
whenever you want!

### Download

When you receive a cid, you can download the `Manifest` to get information about the data:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::download_manifest;

let manifest = download_manifest(&node, "QmExampleCID...")?;
```

It is not mandatory for downloading the data but it is really useful.

There are 2 strategies for downloading: `stream` and `chunks`.

#### stream

The `stream` strategy is the easiest to use.

It provides an `on_progress` callback to receive progress updates and notify the user.
The percentage is calculated from the `dataset_size` (taken from the manifest).
If you don't provide it, you can enable `dataset_size_auto` so `download_stream` fetches the
manifest first and uses its `dataset_size`.

You can pass a `writer` and/or a `filepath` as destinations. They are not mutually exclusive,
letting you write the content to two places for the same download.

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{download_stream, DownloadStreamOptions};
use std::fs::File;

let file = File::create("testdata/hello.downloaded.writer.txt")?;
let options = DownloadStreamOptions::new("QmExampleCID...")
    .writer(file)
    .filepath("testdata/hello.downloaded.txt")
    .on_progress(|progress| {
        println!("Download progress: {} bytes ({}%)",
            progress.bytes_downloaded,
            (progress.percentage * 100.0) as u32);
    });

let result = download_stream(&node, options)?;
```

#### chunks

The `chunks` strategy allows to manage the download by yourself. It requires more code
but provide more flexibility.

This strategy **assumes you already know the total size to download** (from the manifest).
After you believe all chunks have been retrieved, you **must** call `download_cancel`
to terminate the download session.

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{download_init, download_chunk, download_cancel, DownloadInitOptions};

let cid = "QmExampleCID...";
let session_id = download_init(&node, cid, &DownloadInitOptions::new())?;

let chunk = download_chunk(&node, cid)?;
// Process chunk...

download_cancel(&node, cid)?;
```

Using this strategy, you can handle resumable downloads and cancel the download
whenever you want!

### Storage

Several methods are available to manage the data on your node:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{manifests, space, delete, fetch};

let manifests = manifests(&node)?;
let space_info = space(&node)?;

let cid = "QmExampleCID...";
delete(&node, cid)?;
fetch(&node, cid)?;
```

The `fetch` method downloads remote data into your local node.

### P2P

You can connect to a node using the `peer_id` or the `listen_addresses`:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::connect;

let peer_id = "12D3KooWExamplePeerId";
let addrs = vec![
    "/ip4/192.168.1.100/tcp/8080".to_string(),
    "/ip4/192.168.1.100/udp/8080/quic".to_string(),
];

connect(&node, peer_id, &addrs).await?;
```

### Debug

Several methods are available to debug your node:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{debug, update_log_level, peer_debug, LogLevel};

// Get node info
let info = debug(&node).await?;

// Update the chronicles level log on runtime
update_log_level(&node, LogLevel::Debug).await?;

let peer_id = "12D3KooWExamplePeerId";
let record = peer_debug(&node, peer_id)?;
```

`peer_debug` is only available if you built with `-d:codex_enable_api_debug_peers=true` flag.

### Async Support

All operations have async versions available. If you're using async Rust, you can use the async variants:

```rust
use codex_rust_bindings::{CodexNode, CodexConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let config = CodexConfig::new()
        .data_dir("/path/to/data")
        .block_retries(10);

    let mut node = CodexNode::new(config)?;

    // Start the node asynchronously
    node.start_async().await?;

    // Use async operations...

    // Stop the node asynchronously
    node.stop_async().await?;
    node.destroy()?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Context and cancellation

Rust async contexts are exposed only on the long-running operations as `upload_reader`, `upload_file`, and `download_stream`. If the
context is cancelled, those methods cancel the active upload or download. Short lived API calls don't take a context
because they usually finish before a cancellation signal could matter.
